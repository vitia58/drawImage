# Virtual Pendulum

## Disclaimer
This project was made purely for fun and does not represent my professional skills or expertise.

## About the Project
The Virtual Pendulum project is a playful experiment that simulates the motion of a pendulum using SVG and JavaScript. The project demonstrates the basic principles of pendulum motion in a virtual environment, allowing users to visualize and interact with a swinging pendulum on their screen.

## Features
- **Simple Simulation**: Visualize the movement of a pendulum.
- **Interactive Elements**: Adjust parameters like length and gravity to see how they affect the pendulum's motion (if implemented).
- **SVG-Based Graphics**: The pendulum and its path are rendered using scalable vector graphics (SVG), ensuring crisp visuals.

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to explore the basics of pendulum motion and SVG animations in a fun and creative way. It is not intended as a showcase of advanced programming or design skills.

## Getting Started
To see the virtual pendulum in action:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
